# Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree
 
Over the last decade, bicycle share networks have increased in number and prevalence in cities around the world. Bicycle share services allow users to borrow short-distance bicycles, normally 30 minutes or less. Thanks to the increase of information technology, it is easy for the system user to enter the dock inside the system to unlock or return bicycles. These solutions also have a range of data that can be used to analyze how these bike sharing networks are used.

Bay Wheels (known as Ford GoBike) is the Bay Area's new bike sharing scheme, with thousands of shared bikes to be used around San Francisco, East Bay and San Jose. The rental bikes was built with comfort in mind. It's a fun and inexpensive way to travel around town. It also offers a single ride of $2 a day that's ideal for a one-way trip, a monthly membership of $15 a month for a decent price for residents, and a 10 dollar entry pass that's perfect for exploring.

In this project, I will perform an exploratory analysis on data provided by Bay Wheels (Ford GoBike), a bike-share system provider.

**About Dataset:**
I chose [Ford GoBike System Data (Bay Wheels Dataset)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/fordgobike-data/index.html) in Udacity (which is now can be accessed as Bay Wheels) as my source data This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system. Multiple data files need to be joined together for a full year’s coverage.

The features included in the dataset : 
- Trip Duration (seconds)
- Start Time and Date - 
- End Time and Date
- Start Station ID 
- Start Station Name
- Start Station Latitude
- Start Station Longitude
- End Station ID
- End Station Name
- End Station Latitude
- End Station Longitude
- Bike ID
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer – “Subscriber” = Member or “Customer” = Casual)
